demarcating factors:

file sizes
	check *not* rarchive segments
naming schemes ([S/E][#/##])
	specifically on files that constitute X% of folder size
folder structure

Other reliablity checks, for top level eligibility to be parsed as media:

file type
min file size 500ish MB?

file utility gets file type independent of filename ending
